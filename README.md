# Kanban Task Management Web App

This is an adapted version to the [Kanban task management web app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/kanban-task-management-web-app-wgQLt-HlbB).

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the layout in the desktop and tablet screen dimensions (768px, 1024px and 1440px). I haven't done the mobile design because I wouldn't use an app like this in smaller screens and I wanted to practice my React skills in this project.
- Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser

### What I learned

In this project I had to manage various states from different components in order to render the modals and save the state information in a way the app could manage and access that information. I challenged myself not to look at any kind of solution or way to get this project done to ensure that I could come up with a solution by myself and practice my problem-solving skills.
